<!-- HISTORY -->
<section id="history" class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 py-16 text-slate-200">
  <div class="space-y-14">

    <div>
      <strong class="text-orange-400 text-lg">1906</strong>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-2">Built Before Statehood</h3>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        On August 15, 1906, long before Oklahoma carried a star on the flag, we opened our doors as the Terral Telephone Company. This was still Indian Territory, and connection meant something literal. Our entire network was a single copper line stretched across open ground from Fleetwood to Terral—no switching centers, no automation, just wire, wood poles, and resolve.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        If you needed to reach someone miles away, you didn’t dial a number. You stepped into a wooden booth, raised your voice, and trusted that the line would carry it. From the start, this company was built on trust earned the hard way.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <strong class="text-orange-400 text-lg">1930s</strong>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-2">Lines Through the Dust</h3>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        The Dust Bowl and the Great Depression tested every rural operation in the region. Farms failed, towns thinned, and isolation became a daily reality. In 1935, our license to operate cost exactly one dollar—a small sum that masked the true price of survival.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        Keeping the lines alive meant constant repair, long days in the wind, and refusing to abandon neighbors who depended on that connection. When the world felt cut off, these wires kept communities stitched together.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <strong class="text-orange-400 text-lg">1945</strong>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-2">The Cost of Reliability</h3>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        In 1945, our founder J.E. Frisk fell from a telephone pole while working to maintain the network. He lost his life doing the job. That sacrifice is not a footnote here—it is part of the foundation.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        Reliability has never been a slogan. It has always meant showing up, climbing the pole, and keeping the line open no matter the conditions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <strong class="text-orange-400 text-lg">1987–2000s</strong>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-2">From Copper to Glass</h3>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        In 1987, the Segress family took the reins and moved the company forward without breaking its spine. Hand-crank phones gave way to digital switching. Copper lines that once carried voices began carrying data.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        In 2003, we brought wireless broadband to farms, ranches, and oilfields that larger providers passed over. Progress here was never about speed alone—it was about coverage, consistency, and keeping rural Oklahoma connected.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <strong class="text-orange-400 text-lg">Today</strong>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-2">The Digital Chisholm Trail</h3>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        Today, operating as ClearRoute Fiber, we are pulling fiber through the same soil that once held copper. What began as a single line across open land is now a modern fiber backbone supporting homes, businesses, schools, and the regional economy.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        The technology has changed—from a one-dollar license to gigabit speeds—but the promise has not. We are still building the trail forward, one connection at a time, carrying this region into the future along the Digital Chisholm Trail.
